# Project 3 - Generate-TV-Scripts

This Repository stores my solution to the "Generate TV Script" problem presented as the third project in the Deep Learning Nano Degree by Udacity.

In this project, I'll generate my own Seinfeld TV scripts using RNNs. I'll be using part of the Seinfeld dataset of scripts from 9 seasons. 
The interesting part about this project 3 I'll build will generate a new ,"fake" TV script, based on patterns it recognizes in this training data using RNN.
